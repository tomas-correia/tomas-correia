## 🛠️ **Main Projects**

<div align="center">

![Quacker Banner](/images/quackerbanner.png)

</div>

- <ins>A virtual world</ins> that I'm currently working on, where you can swim around as a rubber duck and make new friends.
- Explore funny rooms, collect and wear clothing items, play games and more!
- Highly inspired by Club Penguin.

<h3>🧊 Cube Penguin <i>(2017-2021)</i></h3>

![Cube Penguin Banner](/images/cbpbanner.png)

</div>

- <ins>A former Club Penguin Minecraft server</ins> that recreated the entirety of the Club Penguin virtual world, including a long list of fully working features like minigames, items, parties, puffles, stamps, postcards, mascots, buddies, and many others.

- It was definitely thanks to Cube Penguin, and ultimately to Club Penguin, that I took the first steps and learned the most about programming and many other fields.
Definitely my biggest project so far.

- Nowadays, I'm still passionate about virtual worlds, especially Club Penguin, as it was a big part of my childhood.  
I also remember it was my dream as an 8 year-old kid to work there one day.  
Cube Penguin was definitely the closest I could have got to that, and I'm still extremely proud of what I was able to accomplish.
